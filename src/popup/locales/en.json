Please, bear in mind that every ​USER is solely responsible for the actions undertaken on the application and the information presented by them. \n Password and Security Disclaimer: ​USERS take responsibility for their digital security. The application ​gives the possibility to set up a recovery passphrase, consisting of random unique combination of words. The purpose of the recovery passphrase is to restore the access to the account, once the ​USER has lost access to the original ​Wallet​.

Please bear in mind that if a USER has not set up a recovery passphrase for backup or they have forgotten the recovery passphrase and its exact wording, the access to their accounts can be permanently restricted. The lack of access does not mean in any way that the Superhero.com tokens ​are lost. The ​tokens ​remain available, however, they cannot be controlled, transferred and any other action with them cannot be undertaken. Superhero.com ​shall not be held liable in any case of lost, forgotten or misspelled recovery passphrases. In addition, ​USERS ​must not share their recovery passphrase with anyone.

Devices on which the ​Wallet is installed are likely to be harmed by malware/spyware/viruses/cyber-attacks, etc. or during technical support. Damage or loss of the device can possibly result in loss of funds or endanger them. Therefore, please refer to section Password and Security Disclaimer in regard to recovery passphrases.
